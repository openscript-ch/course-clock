# CourseClock

 CourseClock is a webapp, created entirely with typescript, that allows you to create, edit and organize your course plan, being able to import and export it as pdf or json file.

## Create course

It is as easy as, in The "Allgemein" Tab

1. define the name of the course
2. define the author's name
3. determine the number of days the course will have.

On the "Woche", "Tag" tabs you can create events using a form which will require a name, start and end time as well as an event procedure.

With two clicks on the day or a simple click on 'Segment hinzuf√ºgen' you will access the form.

Once everything is done create the course

## Edit course

Feel free to edit your course plan as much as you like

- edit course name / author
- add/remove days or events
- edit event content
- use drag and drop to move events
- resize events to adapt their duration time

Once satisfied save the course

## Import JSON .file
Dragging your file or simply clicking on json.file imports your course  immediately.
